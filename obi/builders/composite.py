Contents:
    Edge (Sequence): base class for an edge in a graph. Many graphs will not
        require edge instances, but the class is made available for more complex 
        graphs and type checking.
    Graph (base.Composite, Protocol): base class for graphs. All subclasses 
        must have 'connect' and 'disconnect' methods for changing edges between
        nodes.
    Node (base.Proxy): wrapper for items that can be stored in a Graph or other
        data structure.  
    Nodes (bunches.Bunch): any collection of Node instances. This is primarily
        intended for easy type checking of any arbitrary group of objects to 
        make sure they meet the requirements of being a Node (real or virtual) 
        instance.

          
To Do:
    Integrate Kinds system when it is finished.
