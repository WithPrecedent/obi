#     Graph stores a directed acyclic graph (DAG) as an adjacency list. Despite

#     in order to allow use of its extra functionality over a plain dict.
    
#     Graph supports '+' and '+=' to be used to join two piles Graph instances. A
#     properly formatted adjacency list could also be the added object.
    
#     Graph internally supports autovivification where a list is created as a 
#     value for a missing key. This means that a Graph need not inherit from 
#     defaultdict.
